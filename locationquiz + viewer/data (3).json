         "review":"This cliche tourist trap not only is way too crowded but smells literally of urine everywhere. When I say that you can't bring your kids here is because there are street performers that harass you for a picture and some of them are naked and half naked, plus the fact that everyone smokes freely anywhere and so you and your kids will breathe that second hand smoke - keep that in mind next time you bring your kids to get that typical and expected photo at times square.",
